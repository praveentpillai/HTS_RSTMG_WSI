The code files contained in this repository are used to implement the method 'Region Specific Tissue Mask Generation' (RSTMG) described in the research paper 'Heuristic driven Region Specific Tissue Segmentation of Whole Slide Images'. RSTMG can segment the tissue area of any regions or patches of a given high-resolution WSI image from its relatively lower resolution thumbnail image. The file Patchwise_Mask_Generation.ipynb implements RSTMG and the procedures for adapting the codes are elaborated in the respective files.

The dataset for working with the code can be downloaded from the Link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13bDVN1qUpeaAoy3bRO52PEgKJC2PViuH?usp=sharing. Download it to a directory and appropriately set the path in the file. The code has been tested on the Google Colab environment without any GPU support.
